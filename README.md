## Code Journal
- When I first attempted to implement Chart.js libraries into my code I got pretty lost and didn't seem to grasp how to do it. So I read through the achievement description again and realized I was trying to download via npm. After switching over to the cdn download and finding a good tutorial, it became quite simple to understand.  The video I found made it super easy for me to follow along & the author does a very good job at describing his process and what each step is doing. The video also taught be how to implement colors using JavaScript which to my previous understanding, I though I would have to use CSS.
